	Mooxygen is a tool that scans a directory tree containing one or 
	several MOOS modules. Then, mooxygen generates documentation about 
	the variables that each module publishes or subscribes to, from a 
	set of tags added to C++ comments in your code.

	MOOS is a C++ framework for developing distributed applications, 
	mainly focused on mobile robotics.
