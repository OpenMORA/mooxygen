Mooxygen is a tool that scans a directory tree containing one or 
several MOOS modules and generates documentation about 
the variables that each module publishes or subscribes to, from a 
set of tags added to C++ comments in your code. 

Much like `doxygen` does for code, `mooxygen` does at the framework level.

MOOS is a C++ framework for developing distributed applications, 
mainly focused on mobile robotics.
